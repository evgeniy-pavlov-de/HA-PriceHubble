# Private Repository: Data Engineering Interview Assignments & Pet Projects

Welcome to my private repository! This space is dedicated to documenting and organizing my interview test assignments from job searches, as well as personal pet projects related to data engineering.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `interview_assignments/` - Solutions and documentation for interview tests.
- `data_engineering_projects/` - Personal projects exploring data engineering concepts.
- `docs/` - Additional documentation, notes, and references.

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository serves as a personal archive and learning resource. It helps me track my progress, reflect on past assignments, and experiment with new data engineering tools and techniques.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- Python, SQL, and Bash scripting
- ETL frameworks (e.g., Apache Airflow, Luigi)
- Data storage (e.g., PostgreSQL, BigQuery, S3)
- Data processing (e.g., Pandas, Spark)
